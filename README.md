## Predicting CKD with Data Science

In this project, we aim to use data science to predict the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by analyzing risk factors and genes. CKD is a condition where the kidneys are damaged and can not properly filter blood. Because of this, excess fluid and waste remain in the body and can lead to other severe diseases such as heart disease and stroke (CDC). CKD is on the rise, and it is a disease that can not be cured, but can be treated (NHS). We want to explore which risk factors and genes are common in patients with CKD in order to better be able to determine whether or not one is more prone to being diagnosed with CKD. By analyzing both risk factors and genes, the risk for CKD can be detected earlier on and proper action can be taken to prevent one from suffering from severe CKD.
